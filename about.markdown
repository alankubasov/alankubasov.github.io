Hello, my name is Alan Kubasov, a 21 year old, 3rd year uni student.

I am on multiple platforms with the name of KUBASOVISUAL where I upload all my creative works and experiences. From video editing on youtube, to 3D artwork on ArtStation. Feel free to check it out!

I am a pathway student, starting from Dip. of Digital Media Technologies, to Advanced Dip. of Screen and Media. Now Studying Bach. of Design (Digital Media)

I am currently working at a motorwear store as a social media manager. 

My skillsets vary, but coding is definately a weakness.

Always eager to learn.
