This week supposedly I learnt:
Classes (& synths, & mouse), Images (& webcam), Text (& rita) and Sound files (& keyboard interaction), while still getting to familiarise myself with it, I plan to include a few sketches here of what I learnt. As of now, when I missed two classes, I am currently learning what to do and how to do it. 

Bear with me!
