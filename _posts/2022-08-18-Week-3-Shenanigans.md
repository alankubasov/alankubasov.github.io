This week supposedly I learnt:
Classes (& synths, & mouse), Images (& webcam), Text (& rita) and Sound files (& keyboard interaction), while still getting to familiarise myself with it, I plan to include a few sketches here of what I learnt. As of now, when I missed two classes, I am currently learning what to do and how to do it. 


Playing around with the synths, the angle they nodes fly and play at, the pitch and soundwave of the synth, the cutoff, the reverb and much more.

Playing with the image distortion effects and such, the most I analyse the code and rebuild it myself, the more I understand and the possibilities are endless. From changing the speed, width, shape and style the image renders in you can create some really minimal or detailed pieces of imagery.

Things are getting wild with arrays, I'm learning how the cursor could be tracked and you can place your own cursor and animate it, like using the y++ or x++ functions to continously make the dots fall or get smaller.

The i statement when using arrays is really interesting, the for of loop and how to use objects as arrays could be implemented in different creative ways, I just need to figure out how to make the trail a different colour.

I tried to replicate a water streak in this one, where the waves look white. I think that if I make the trail white, duplicate another one on top and make it smaller and white, it could look like tiny water streaks or waves moving against the water.
