This week supposedly I learnt:
Classes (& synths, & mouse), Images (& webcam), Text (& rita) and Sound files (& keyboard interaction), while still getting to familiarise myself with it, I plan to include a few sketches here of what I learnt. As of now, when I missed two classes, I am currently learning what to do and how to do it. 


Playing around with the synths, the angle they nodes fly and play at, the pitch and soundwave of the synth, the cutoff, the reverb and much more.

Playing with the image distortion effects and such, the most I analyse the code and rebuild it myself, the more I understand and the possibilities are endless. From changing the speed, width, shape and style the image renders in you can create some really minimal or detailed pieces of imagery.
