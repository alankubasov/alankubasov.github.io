Ahhh vectors, what a way to start my javascript exploration. Learning theory such as setting up the canvas through setup() and draws() to actually creating things? Awesome. 


Here is an exaple of what I managed to do by myself. Impressive I know, thanks.

I had no clue what I was doing. 

But what I did learn was how JavaScript works and got a better understanding of how everything connects. Between JS, P5, Github, Html etc. It might've taken a while but I got there from the ground up.

I thought I had an understanding of code but apparently I didn't. From being lost I now understand how code comments work, print & log, frameCounts and Loops, Variables, Colour codes, X and Y positioning, Randoms and Iterations and now getting myself to solidify that knowledge and experience/play around with arrays, noise and animations. 

I have a basic understanding of frameCount and how it makes it into a conditional logic in JS. 


Follow me for next weeks adventure, where I hopefully learn how to blog properly.
