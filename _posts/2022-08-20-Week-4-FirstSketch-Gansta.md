Hello and welcome to my first properly created blog where I showcase to you my sketch. 
I did miss two weeks of content but managed to start everything from the ground up and continously learning JavaScript.

During Week 4 we learnt about Web API (which specifies how to plug one piece of software into another piece 
of software), especially the web Audio API: Synths mathematics
○ building a synthesiser with nodes:
■ oscillators
■ amplifiers
■ filters
■ panners

You can see my experimentation with P5 here - I posted it in week 3 as I was away in class and used my own time to catch up
