I did miss two weeks of content but managed to start everything from the ground up and continously learning JavaScript. 

Today we learned about how to integrate and buffer audio into web, using different variables and methods. For example on click commands and array buffers. finding the audio, passing it onto the function and using the playback rate. 

Even though I missed two classes which was detrimental, I managed to familirise myself with using API's and plugging them into HTML, as well as using javascript without P5js, using sound API (which I plan to use in my future project) and the many different creative applications I can use them for.  




During Week 4 we learnt about Web API (which specifies how to plug one piece of software into another piece 
of software), especially the web Audio API: Synths mathematics
○ building a synthesiser with nodes:
■ oscillators
■ amplifiers
■ filters
■ panners

You can see my experimentation with P5 here - I posted it in week 3 as I was away in class and used my own time to catch up
