Hello, 

My name is Alan Kubasov and I present to you my first ever blogging experience!

Here I will be demonstrating and showcasing my JavaScript and Creative Coding Skillset from 0 to 100.

Bear with me in this journey with Thomas, my lecturer.


Also do check out my design and artwork at @KUBASOVISUAL


Testing out the embedding feature for a sketch!
